Welcome to my personal website.

I currently work as a data scientist at [Inspera AS](https:/www.inspera.com), an EdTech company based in Oslo, Norway.

I use this website to blog about quantitative methods and programming, and to host sample code and data.

Please visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/ngoet) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/ndg90/) pages to learn more about my work.
