Welcome to my website.

I am a data scientist at [Inspera AS](http://www.inspera.com), an EdTech company based in Oslo, Norway.

I use this website to blog about quantitative methods and programming, and to host sample code and data.

Please visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/ngoet) page to learn more about my work.
