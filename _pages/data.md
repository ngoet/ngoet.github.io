As part of my PhD project on rules of debate and polarisation in the UK House of Commons, I gathered historical data covering the period 1811-2015. Some of of these data are available on this page (and more will be released soon).

# Polarisation in the UK House of Commons, 1811-2015
Building on a classification accuracy approach introduced by [Peterson and Spirling (2018)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-analysis/article/classification-accuracy-as-a-substantive-quantity-of-interest-measuring-polarization-in-westminster-systems/45746D999CFCD1CB43E362392D7B2FB4), and my PhD work, the graph below shows levels of polarisation in the UK Parliament for the period 1811-2015. "Polarisation" is defined as how predictive language use is of party membership in a given session (measured on a 0-1 scale), and is estimated on the basis of records of parliamentary speeches from [Hansard](http://www.hansard-archive.parliament.uk). In simple terms, the measure is generated by fitting a training algorithm to a set of parliamentary speeches in a session with party labels, and taking the accuracy from predicting a held-out subset of speeches (which are also labelled). The data for the graph can be viewed in the table below, and are also available in .csv format [via this link]({{ site.url }}/data/polarisationUKHCSO.csv). Please cite [this paper]({{ site.url }}/references/Goet2017.bib) if you intend to use these data for your research.
